# Quantiles

This script is designed to create quantile plots for communicating a validity to non-technical audiences using bar plots.  The script imports your data from Excel, creates quantiles (default = 5) on the predicted score, and plots the mean actual criterion score for each quantile.  It will then save the quantiles in a new XLSX file.

The simulated data in this example have a correlation of r = .5 (N = 1000, M = 50, SD = 10 [for both acutal and predicted values])
